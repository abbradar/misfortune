general cleanup, docs, etc
support reading fortune-mod strfiles (there's an implementation in the cruft/ dir, just needs to be integrated into the main code)
support operating on fortunes with broken or missing index files (probably by creating an in-memory index)

use MISFORTUNE_PATH for defaultFortuneFiles too
more flexible length restriction options - probably flags to allow user to specify range of lengths of both lines and chars

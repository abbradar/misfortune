figure out what to do about attributions of quote databases...
%
support reading fortune-mod strfiles (there's an implementation in the cruft/ dir, just needs to be integrated into the main code)
%
more flexible length restriction options - probably flags to allow user to specify range of lengths of both lines and chars
%
rebuild broken index when opening a fortune file in write mode (?)

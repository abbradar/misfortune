endian mirrors the decimal
%
primary elemental assumption of integer coefficients to roots in counting sytem is wrong
%
actually it bug in math
%
b*(Floor[v/b^p]/b-Floor[Floor[v/b^p]/b])
%
proofs are no longer sound
%
my proof show math is broken right now
%
doctor just give meds not fix prollem
%
Keal was so happy with T, coded in basic so run on anything, and does lot
%
one prollem. T broke confines of the visual basic langage and would not compile
%
perhaps i just genius and never tested
%
and yes that was with zero formal training in all realms
%
somone would expect that trees 500gb hdds of expressions as if they were floppy dicks
%
can you make a macro that builds the expression accoridng to a genetic algorithm where you decide what is good and what is bad?
%
T could perform expressions 600mb and bigger
%
what is the max amount of operands haskell can handle in a single expression?
%
T seems to be haskell, except with a decent interface at this point
%
love a black and white lower 128 from 32 up of ascii glyphs?
%
evaluating expressions is ALL haskell does?????
%
you think i am one of them persnipity uppity men are pig lesbian mathematicians?
%
how bout i say ick no unicorn and daisy loving girl mathematician will ever enjoy this
%
better be atleast 16x16 color with extended ascii set
%
what the hell does Prelude > mean?
%
how do i search for someone saying 'Keal' in mirc
%
i have basically written a proof that shows an assumption is wrong
%
they dumbified you
%
antiparsimony were 100% correct...
%
its because the timeline diverges and past events themselves unhappen
%
all i know is i have experienced my own death unhappening...
%
 what have you been smoking? you narrow minded Haskell user?
%
i use an 8088
%
are there full body recognition files for sorting art?
%
my very first computer was an 80-0840
%
it is very easy to go off topic
%
someone needs to write a boids for haskell that emulates humans going on and off topic
%
i just got banned from math because i not have good ability to convey thoughts
%
i lack in verbal and social expression
%
i try make program called Glyph to do it but my script lang called T too slow. i invent T
%
can GMP support KealDigit? I invent KealDigit
%
with KealDigit quantum crackproof encryption possible
%
i show how spell triangle in less than three corners using darkmanifold
%
can haskell pipe the raw irrational megaequation into an analog device
%
the fractal is 5 irrationals
%
99% of my book has been erased by faulty hdd's
%
last day i was in my lab i had a diagram which might have removed pi
%
i only trust opensource tools. where can i download haskell for windows?
%
obviously you never heard of Tier. theoretically it would work using nanobots
%
you need a Zh function in Haskell
%
can haskell compile flash animations and java apps?
%
i need math friendly compiler to compile for jvm or flash
%
Cale etc already pointed out Haskell is puny to nothing to emulate using my barrage of mathematic theories
%
i prove infinity never ends in both directions
%
are you saying i am MegaMonad?
%
Keal angry @ dons
%
i can explain why something is without knowing what the rules decided by man are
%
making a bot of me is highly offensive
%
just seeing how offtopic i could get everyone
%
intuitive != imperative
%
doubles and floats cause b*(Floor[v/b^p]/b-Floor[Floor[v/b^p]/b) to fuck up
%
what are epsilons?
%
haskell always said undefined
%
bot seems useless
%
when i put what i dat recoved from that tile into a ti92. the damn thing blew up
%
i think it because mathematics damage you cpu
%
ithink has to do with hardcased government failsafe in chip
%
i suggest you tear apart a 20q and plug it with the alg
%
nsa has all the profiling info you need to come up with the correct survey answers
%
write an algorthim that generates the correct responses for a phone survey based on number of rings whether answered how quickly hung up on and the mood of the receiver
%
where can i find opensource schematics of Linus Torvalds' x86 clone?
%
need to plan a fieldtrip to Frederick B. Mancoff of Freescale Semiconductor
%
ghc need to have plugin that allow copy paste in xp
%
know you know this 24 periods Keal SecretTM
%
tomorrow i share next mathematical secrety
%
nsa prevent me from returning to math on efnet
%
nsa try kill me numerous times
%
#haskell needs to take its meds
%
i think i know what code does but code looks to simple to actually do it
%
need 1 to do a while 0 does !a. need 1 to do a while 0 does !a
%
will it return [] if map gives fpu infinite list?
%
today's 24hour project was supposed to be logical overloading using plegm method
%
there is no way to prove the failsafe exists
%
oh btw my fpu is blown due to a hardcased failsafe i have 3 year warranty right. and then they call fads
%
i aint running that on my puter
%
lamadabot took 5 to 8 whole seconds to return []
%
bot defective
%
i changed my user od
%
i cant think anymore
%
i want to invent white dye
%
pork steaks taste like dick
%
i dont really eat vegetables unless cheese is a vegetable
%
the [nsa] even make light green both ways once
%
i still dont understand how gci is supposed to do anything other than mathematics
